    <p class="text-center">After secondary school, I managed to enter Singapore Polytechnic through PFP (Polytechnic Foundation Programme). 
      I decided to enter PFP as I didn't want to enter ITE, and wanted to have an achievement in my life. I felt happy that I 
      manage to enter because I didn't want the hard work I spent on studying for my N-Levels to go to waste. Looking back, although some of
      the things I learnt wasn't beneficial for my diploma, the one year spent in PFP was worth it as I got to 
      meet many new people and make new friends, as well as have a glimpse on how polytechnic life is like.
