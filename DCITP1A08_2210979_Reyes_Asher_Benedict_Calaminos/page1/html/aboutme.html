                    were the most memorable ones that I made and the friendships that I made were unforgettable, even until today I still keep in contact with some of my secondary

    <p class="text-center col-md-10 justify-content-center align-items-center mx-auto">After secondary school, I managed to enter Singapore Polytechnic through PFP (Polytechnic Foundation Programme). 
      I decided to enter PFP as I didn't want to enter ITE, and wanted to have an achievement in my life. I felt happy that I 
      manage to enter because I didn't want the hard work I spent on studying for my N-Levels to go to waste. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">The one year I spent in PFP gave me the chance to join CCAs that I was interested in, such as SP Fencing. I made many friends in Fencing through the 
      training sessions and we would go to the Each A Cup that was located at Dover MRT after training sessions to get bubbble tea.

          <p class="text-center pb-4">The one year in PFP also gave me the chance to experience how polytechnic life was going to be,. It was hard adjusting at first as I have to wake up at different timings for the different timings my classes started back then, but over time I slowly
            got used to it. I also made new friends in my PFP class and even though we are now in different courses, we still keep in contact.

    <p class="text-center container col-md-8">PFP (Polytechnic Foundation Programme) is a one year programme that is for the top 10% of N-Level students. Instead of going to
      Secondary 5 and do O-Levels, they can enter SP through PFP and get a provisional place in their respective course.
      Before they go into their diploma, they have to complete a series of modules and pass them in order to progress to to their respective diplomas.
